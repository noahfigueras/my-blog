# Challenge #1 - Unstoppable
 There's a lending pool with a million DVT tokens in balance, offering flash loans for free.

 If only there was a way to attack and stop the pool from offering flash loans ...

 You start with 100 DVT tokens in balance.

# Exploit 
In this challenge, the ``UnstoppableLender.sol`` smart contract has a vulnerability that 
we can exploit in order to stop the free flashloans.  

The smart contract uses a variable to keep track of the balance of the pool called 
``poolBalance``. This variable is updated every time the ``depositTokens()`` is executed 
trying to keep track of the pool dvt tokens balance. But, there's only one problem and it's 
that we can use the dvt token transfer function to transfer dvt tokens to the smart contract 
and that ``poolBalance`` variable will not update.  

Knowing that, in the ``flashloan()`` I see that it checks for any discrepancies in the ``poolBalance`` 
variable and the real balance of the address of the tokens in: ``assert(poolBalance == balanceBefore)``.  
So, updating the balance of dvt tokens of the smart contract address without updating ``poolBalance`` variable 
will cause the ``flashloan()`` to stop issuing free loans.

```js
	it('Exploit', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE */
         // Show it's possible for someUser to take out a flash loan
		 await this.token.connect(attacker).transfer(this.pool.address, INITIAL_ATTACKER_TOKEN_BALANCE);
	});
```
